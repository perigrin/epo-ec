The Enlightened Perl Extended Core
==================================

The Goal of the EPO-EC working group is to produce a List of modules that are considered "Best of Breed" modules for domains typically encountered by a large Perl Enterprise or Consulting business. This list will be package into a standard distribution and work will be made to integrate this distribution with the standard installation channels for popular Operating System vendors.

The chairman of the working group Chris Prather gave an [introduction][1] to the EPO Extended Core project at YAPC::NA 2009 in Pittsburgh. This talk followed Matt Trout's [Catching an STD][2] which provided a good introduction to the reasons for starting such a project.
