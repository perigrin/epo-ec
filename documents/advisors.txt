Small script for contacting an advisor:

Hi, I'm [The Doctor] from the EPO Extended Core Working Group and we were
wondering if you'd be interested in being an advisor for us. Basically what
we'd want you to do would only take about an hour a month and you'd just look
over a list of modules and issues we have and make comments on them. We
approached you because of your position as [Empororer of the Daleks] and we're
trying to pull together a group of people who are well respected by the
community in their respective domains.

Thanks
[The Doctor]
